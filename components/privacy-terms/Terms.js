          archive in a securised location. Contrary to popular belief,
          Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
          piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
          over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
          at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
          more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
          passage, and going through the cites of the word in
          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
          Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
          &rdquo;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&rdquo; (The Extremes of
          Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
          treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
          Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &rdquo;Lorem
          ipsum dolor sit amet..&rdquo;, comes from a line in section
          1.10.32.
