          archive in a securised location. Contrary to popular belief,
          Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
          piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
          over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
          at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
          more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
          passage, and going through the cites of the word in
          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
          Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
          Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
          by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
          theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
          first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
          comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
